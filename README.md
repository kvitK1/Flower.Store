# LittleFlowerStore
Naive implementation of a *flower store*.

Nothing ðŸ¤©, just lots of fighting with **linter**.


- class **Flower** that implements the essence of Rose, Chamomile, and Tulip in a flower store.

  The class has attributes #sepalLength, #color, and #price.

- **FlowerPack** class with attributes #flower and #amount. Has method *****getPrice***** in it.

- **FlowerBucket** class that will aggregate several **FlowerPack**. Has method *****getPrice***** in it.

- class **Store** and method *****search***** in it.
